### DISCLAIMER:

- Please do not buy packages before contacting me directly. We usually need a development plan and check for feasibility and availability before undergoing such processes.  
- I will not accept scammers or projects that sound like scams.  
- Do not contact me if your intention is malicious and based on greed.  
- Smart contracts typically require an owner address and incur deployment fees (e.g. gas fees on Ethereum). These fees and the responsibility for deploying, publishing, and managing the contract rest solely with the buyer.  
- I provide development services only. I am not liable for how the contract or application is used, marketed, or distributed after delivery. It is your responsibility to ensure that the project complies with all relevant laws, platform policies, licenses, and ethical standards.  
- Keep your assets and information safe. Cryptocurrency services focus solely on developing and programming. Never share sensitive information or private keys with others.
